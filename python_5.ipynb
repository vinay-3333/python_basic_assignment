        "Multiple inheritance is a concept in object-oriented programming (OOP) where a class can inherit properties and behaviors from more than one parent class. In other words, a class can be derived from multiple base classes. This allows a class to inherit attributes and methods from multiple sources, enabling it to exhibit characteristics and behaviors from multiple parent classes simultaneously.\n",
        "\n",
        "For example, consider a programming scenario where you have classes A and B, and you want to create a new class C that inherits attributes and methods from both A and B. This is an example of multiple inheritance.\n",

        "Multiple inheritance can be a powerful tool for code reuse and modeling complex relationships between classes. However, it can also lead to complications and ambiguities in some cases, such as when two parent classes have methods or attributes with the same name. To address these issues, programming languages that support multiple inheritance often provide rules or mechanisms to resolve conflicts, such as method overriding and explicit scoping."

        "ChatGPT\n",
        "Delegation is a design pattern and a programming concept used in object-oriented programming (OOP) and software engineering. It involves one object passing on a task or responsibility to another object to perform the task on its behalf. In essence, delegation allows objects to work together by distributing tasks among them, promoting code reuse and making the code more modular and maintainable.\n",
        "\n",
        "Here are the key aspects of delegation:\n",
        "\n",
        "Task Offloading: Delegation allows an object (the delegator) to delegate specific tasks or responsibilities to another object (the delegate). The delegator doesn't handle these tasks directly but relies on the delegate to perform them.\n",
        "\n",
        "Code Reuse: Delegation promotes code reuse by allowing different objects to share common behavior. Instead of duplicating code in multiple classes, you can delegate the shared functionality to a single delegate object.\n",
        "\n",
        "Separation of Concerns: Delegation helps in separating concerns in a program. The delegator object is responsible for one aspect of the functionality, while the delegate object is responsible for another. This separation simplifies the design and maintenance of the code.\n",
        "\n",
        "Dynamic Behavior: Delegation often involves dynamic dispatch, meaning the choice of the delegate object can be made at runtime. This flexibility allows for runtime customization of the behavior of an object.\n",
        "\n",
        "Composition over Inheritance: Delegation is an alternative to inheritance for sharing behavior between objects. Instead of inheriting behavior from a superclass, an object can delegate specific tasks to another object, adhering to the \"composition over inheritance\" principle.\n",
        "\n",
        "Delegation is commonly used in many programming languages, and it's a fundamental concept in frameworks and libraries to create flexible and extensible code. It's especially useful when you want to build systems where objects need to collaborate and share responsibilities without tightly coupling their implementations."

        "answer:-\n",
        "\n",
        "Composition is a fundamental concept in object-oriented programming (OOP) and software engineering that involves constructing complex objects by combining simpler objects. It is a way to create relationships between classes or objects in a manner that allows for code reuse and modularity. Composition is often contrasted with inheritance as a means of achieving code reuse and creating complex structures.\n",
        "\n",
        "Key points about composition:\n",
        "\n",
        "Combining Objects: In composition, a complex object is built by assembling or \"composing\" several simpler objects. These simpler objects are often instances of other classes and can be thought of as parts or components of the larger object.\n",
        "\n",
        "Has-A Relationship: Composition establishes a \"has-a\" relationship between the containing (complex) object and the contained (simpler) objects. For example, a Car class might be composed of objects like an Engine, Wheels, and Transmission.\n",
        "\n",
        "Modularity: Composition promotes modularity in your code. Each component or part is a self-contained unit that can be developed, tested, and maintained independently. Changes in one component generally don't affect others as long as the interface remains consistent.\n",
        "\n",
        "Code Reuse: Composition allows for code reuse by creating a library of smaller, reusable components. These components can be used in various contexts to build different complex objects.\n",
        "\n",
        "Flexibility: Complex objects can be created dynamically by selecting and combining components at runtime. This flexibility is useful when different objects with different configurations are needed.\n",
        "\n",
        "Encapsulation: Each component in composition should encapsulate its behavior and data, and the containing object should interact with its components through well-defined interfaces."

        "Pseudoprivate attributes in Python are a way to create attributes with a limited form of name mangling, making it more difficult for subclasses or external code to accidentally or intentionally override or access them. The purpose of pseudoprivate attributes is to provide a level of data encapsulation and prevent unintended interference with an object's internal state.\n",
        "\n",
        "In Python, pseudoprivate attributes are denoted by a double underscore prefix before the attribute name, like __my_private_var.

This makes it harder to accidentally override the attribute in a subclass or access it from outside the class.\n",
        "\n",
