        "\n",
        "Exception processing, often referred to as exception handling, is a fundamental concept in programming that allows you to deal with unexpected or exceptional situations that may arise during the execution of a program. Here are three common applications for exception processing:\n",
        "\n",
        "Error Handling: Exception processing is primarily used for error handling. When a program encounters an error, such as a division by zero, a file not found, or an invalid input, it can raise an exception to gracefully handle the error instead of crashing the program. By catching and handling exceptions, you can provide meaningful error messages to users or take corrective actions, ensuring the program continues to run without termination.\n",
        "\n",
        "Example:\n",
        "\n",
        "python\n",
        "Copy code\n",
        "try:\n",
        "    result = 10 / 0  # This will raise a ZeroDivisionError\n",
        "except ZeroDivisionError:\n",
        "    print(\"Error: Division by zero is not allowed.\")\n",
        "Resource Cleanup: Exception processing is useful for managing resources, like file handling, network connections, and database connections. When working with external resources, it's essential to ensure that these resources are properly released or closed, even if an exception occurs. You can use a finally block to guarantee that resource cleanup code runs regardless of whether an exception is raised."

        "answer:-\n",
        "\n",
        "If you don't do something extra to treat an exception, which typically involves catching and handling the exception, the exception will propagate up the call stack. In other words, it will continue to \"bubble up\" through the program until it is either caught and handled or until it reaches the top level of the program, in which case it can cause the program to terminate abruptly.\n",
        "\n",
        "Here's what happens when you don't handle an exception:\n",
        "\n",
        "Propagation: When an exception is raised in a block of code, the program will immediately stop executing the current block and begin searching for an exception handler. It will look for a suitable try...except block to catch the exception. If it doesn't find one in the current block, it will continue to the enclosing block or function.\n",
        "\n",
        "Call Stack Unwinding: If the exception is not caught in the current function or block, the program will unwind the call stack, moving up through the functions that were called to reach the current point in the code. It will continue to search for an exception handler in higher-level functions or blocks.\n",
        "\n",
        "Termination: If the exception propagates all the way to the top level of the program without being caught and handled, the program will terminate. In most programming languages, an unhandled exception will result in an error message or traceback that provides information about the exception and where it occurred. This can lead to a program crash.\n",
        "\n",
        "In summary, not handling exceptions appropriately can lead to program termination, causing a potentially bad user experience and making it difficult to diagnose and resolve issues. To prevent this, it's essential to use exception handling mechanisms like try...except blocks to catch and handle exceptions or at least provide a graceful way to handle errors and continue the program's execution.\n",
